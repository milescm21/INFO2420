    <ol>
        <li>1. What was your first impression of this site?
            I liked the look of it. It was very well organized and put an emphasis on pictures and 
            showing the beauty of Utah.
        </li>
        <li>2. How does this site organize the flow of information?
            (Do they have links on the left and test on the right?
            Some other scheme? No scheme?)
            The site has a navigation bar at the top with a search to look through the whole site.
            Throughout the page there are links to other pages on the site that keep you well informed.
        </li>
        <li>3. Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you?
            Why?
            I think the structure makes sense. It shows the national parks and gives you links on what to do there.
            It is very intuitive.
        </li>
        <li>4. Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhanse the site 
            or detract from it? Why?
            I think that it

        <li>5. How long did it take for the home page to load?
            Was the load time reasonable?
            It did not take long for the home page to load. The load time was very reasonable.
        </li>
        <li>6. Was the text color and size readable?
            If a background color or image was used, did it enhance
            or detract from the site?
            The text was very readable and a background image was used for part of the site.
            I think that the picture enhanced the site and made you want to visit Utah.
        </li>
        <li>7. Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool?
            Was the navigation well done?
            It had navigation in the top right and I think it was well done.
        </li>
        <li>8. Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was
             repeated on all the pages?
             Yes it did
        </li>
        <li>9. How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)?
            It works well in a smaller window and still looks good.
        </li>
        <li>10. What does the site offer that was unusual or very well done?
            It did very well that the site was full of things but didn't seem too crowded with
