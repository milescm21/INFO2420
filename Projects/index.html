        <li>1. What was your first impression of this site?</li>
        <li>2. How does this site organize the flow of information?
            (Do they have links on the left and test on the right?
            Some other scheme? No scheme?)
        </li>
        <li>3. Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you?
            Why?
        </li>
        <li>4. Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhanse the site 
            or detract from it? Why?
        </li>
        <li>5. How long did it take for the home page to load?
            Was the load time reasonable?
        </li>
        <li>6. Was the text color and size readable?
            If a background color or image was used, did it enhance
            or detract from the site?
        </li>
        <li>7. Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool?
            Was the navigation well done?
        </li>
        <li>8. Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was
             repeated on all the pages?
        </li>
        <li>9. How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)?</li>
        <li>10. What does the site offer that was unusual or very well done?</li>
    </ol>
